# AuthMeVelocityForcedHosts
A plugin that adds forced hosts to AuthMeVelocity

Feel free to open issues for any issues or suggestions.

## Installation
If you haven't already, set up AuthMeVelocity. Then put the `.jar` file into the plugins folder (on velocity), then restart your server and set up the config.yml and restart again.

This is the default config.yml:
```yaml
# here you can define forced hosts, restart velocity to reload
forced_hosts:
  pvp.example.com: pvp
```

## Contributing
This is one of my first open-source project so don't expect much, but I will be updating this to the newest version of AuthMeVelocity frequently. Feel free to contribute but I will probably miss your pull request because I don't check here often.
